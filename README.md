# Code Refactor Starter Code
In this project I refactored the provided code to demonstrate proper semantic HTML and CSS structure. This included consolidating the CSS styles sheet of classes that shared the same attributes as well as using semantic elements such as: header, footer, section, aside and main instead of using a general tag such as <div>.
After completing this, the HTML and CSS is much easier to follow and comprehend to those reading the code and wanting to make adjustments.
